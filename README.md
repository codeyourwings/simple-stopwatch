# simple-stopwatch
This is a simple stopwatch created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is the first functioning program that I've built completely on my own without the help of any tutorials.
Definitely the training wheels are off now!
It's the first in a series of simple programs that I am creating.

Do check out the code, I've tried to write readable code that's self-explanatory.
